'''FUSE Filesystem 4 Dropbox''' is a FUSE plugin whichs allows a local mount of your
global Dropbox or jailed application folder.

To improve the browsing experience of your Dropbox content this plugin will cache
the structure for a certain amount of time. There's still some work to do to improve
the caching routine.

=== Authorize access ===
Select the access mode and get the access token for your Dropbox account at:
[http://api.schmidt.ps/authFUSEFilesystem4Dropbox http://api.schmidt.ps/authFUSEFilesystem4Dropbox]

After validation an access token is displayed which you have to enter at the first runtime
of this FUSE plugin. 

'''Please secure you access token. NOBODY may know it! This token allows full access
to your configured dropbox space.'''
