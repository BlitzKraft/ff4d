'''FUSE Filesystem 4 Dropbox''' is a FUSE plugin whichs allows a local mount of your
global Dropbox or jailed application folder.

To improve the browsing experience of your Dropbox content this plugin will cache
the structure for a certain amount of time. There's still some work to do to improve
the caching routine.

=== Authorize access ===
Select the access mode and get the access token for your Dropbox account at:
[http://api.schmidt.ps/authFUSEFilesystem4Dropbox http://api.schmidt.ps/authFUSEFilesystem4Dropbox]

After validation an access token is displayed which you have to enter at the first runtime
of this FUSE plugin. 

''As an alternative'' you can use the enclosed '''./getDropboxAccessToken.py''' script to fetch
the token. But remember that you have to add an Dropbox application within
the [https://www.dropbox.com/developers Dropbox Developer home] by yourself, too.

'''Please secure you access token. NOBODY may know it! This token allows full access
to your configured dropbox space.'''

=== Usage ===
To use this FUSE plugin you just have to install fuse and this plugin.
The start is really simple:

 ./ff4d.py <mount folder> [acesstoken]

The accesstoken can optionally supplied via commandline. Normaly the plugin will ask you just one time
and saves it to a configuration file.

Greets and have fun with this little goodie...
